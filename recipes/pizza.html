  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
    Pizza is a universally adored Italian creation built on a thin, hand-stretched or pan-style dough base that bakes to a crisp, golden crust. 
    It's typically layered with a tangy tomato sauce seasoned with garlic and oregano, then blanketed in creamy, melting mozzarella (or other regional cheeses). 
    From classic Margherita with fresh basil to hearty meat-lover's or veggie-packed gourmet pies, the endless topping combinations let every slice cater to individual tastes. 
    Served straight from the oven, pizza's warm, chewy bite and perfectly blistered edges make it a comforting, shareable meal enjoyed around the world.

  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Pizza dough (enough for a 12-14″ pie)</li>
    <li>2-3 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>1/2 cup pizza or tomato sauce</li>
    <li>8 oz shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>1 tsp dried oregano or Italian seasoning</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder (optional)</li>
    <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
    <li>Fresh basil leaves (optional)</li>
    <li>Your choice of toppings (e.g., pepperoni slices, sliced mushrooms, bell peppers, olives, etc.)</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Steps</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 475 °F (245 °C), placing a pizza stone or inverted baking sheet on the middle rack if you have one.</li>
    <li>Stretch or roll the dough on a lightly floured surface into a 12-14″ circle (or rectangle), leaving a slightly thicker rim for the crust.</li>
    <li>Transfer the shaped dough to a piece of parchment paper or a well-floured pizza peel.</li>
    <li>Brush the outer rim with olive oil, then lightly season the entire surface with a pinch of salt, pepper, and garlic powder.</li>
    <li>Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the dough, stopping about 1/2″ from the edge.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella over the sauce, then dust with oregano or Italian seasoning.</li>
    <li>Arrange your desired toppings over the cheese in a single layer.</li>
    <li>Slide the pizza (on the parchment or peel) onto the preheated stone or baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
    <li>Remove, let rest for 2-3 minutes, then garnish with fresh basil leaves, slice, and serve hot.</li>
  </ol>

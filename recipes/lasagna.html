  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
    Lasagna is a classic Italian casserole dish made by layering wide, flat pasta sheets with rich meat or vegetable ragù, creamy béchamel or ricotta cheese, and plenty of melted mozzarella and Parmesan. 
    As it bakes, the flavors meld together, creating a harmonious balance of savory sauce, tender pasta, and gooey cheese. 
    Variations abound—from spinach and mushroom fillings to spicy sausage or seafood—but the comforting, hearty essence remains the same. 
    Whether served at a family gathering or enjoyed as leftovers, lasagna always feels like a warm, satisfying embrace.

  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
    <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
    <li>1 medium onion</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
    <li>28 oz can crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>6 oz can tomato paste</li>
    <li>olive oil</li>
    <li>dried basil</li>
    <li>dried oregano</li>
    <li>salt and pepper, to taste</li>
    <li>15 oz ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>basil</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Steps</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 375 °F (190 °C).</li>
    <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions (if using regular noodles), then drain and lay them flat on a sheet of parchment or a lightly oiled baking sheet.</li>
    <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Sauté the diced onion until translucent, add the garlic for 30 seconds, then brown the ground beef (or sausage) until fully cooked.</li>
    <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Let the sauce simmer on low for 10-15 minutes.</li>
    <li>In a bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, and grated Parmesan; season lightly with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9 x 13″ baking dish. Layer three noodles over the sauce, then top with one-third of the ricotta mixture, one-third of the mozzarella, and more meat sauce.</li>
    <li>Repeat the layering twice more (noodles → ricotta → mozzarella → sauce), finishing with a final sprinkle of mozzarella on top.</li>
    <li>Cover the dish tightly with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake an additional 20 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and slightly golden.</li>
    <li>Let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing to allow it to set.</li>
    <li>Garnish with fresh basil or parsley, slice into squares, and serve warm.</li>
  </ol>
